**Some notes:** 

-The extension is able to retrieve most of the needed data on its own

-When the extension cannot retrieve all the needed data, they can be inputted manually

-This is also a example extension so when the "add to wishlist" button is clicked, the item is added but,
is but stored temporarily, and lost when the extension is closed.

-Some sites are not supported, sites specially supported are as follows: bestbuy, amazon, bose, thebodyshop, buybuybaby, columbiasportswear, garageclothing, fossil, thebay, chapters, nike, walmart, thesource

**Troubleshooting:**

Chrome may need to authenticate youself before allowing you to switch developer mode on
