Getting Started:

-Download this repo

-Launch chrome://extensions

-Switch developer mode on 

-load repo into extensions page 


Some notes: 

-The extension is able to retrieve most of the needed data on its own

-When the extension cannot retrieve all the needed data, they can be inputted manually

-This is also a example extention so when the "add to wishlist" button is clicked, the item is added but,
is but stored temporarily, and lost when the extension is closed.

Troubleshooting:

Chrome may need to authenticate youself before allowing you to switch developer mode on
